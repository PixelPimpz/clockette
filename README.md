# CLOCKETTE (for tmux)

A small date & time display unit for use in GRUVBAR. It 
generates a tmux option that ccan be formatted and used
in a statusbar. It is a basic loadable unit for GRUVBAR.
A tmux colorscheme & status bar that can interface with
(Neo)Vim which can eliminate the need for a status bar 
in (neo)Vim. 

This is all a vehicle for me to learn better scripting
skills, lua skills, tmux and nvim as programs and as 
things to program. It's fun. 

Feel free to hit me up if you see something or want to 
enlighten me to soomething that might help. I'm a code
sponge.
